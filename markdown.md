#Markdown request 

I have learnt the following :

1. What is git and how to use git. 
2. Downloaded github on my laptop and cloned into my local system.
3. To create a pull request.
4. A new feature branch was created.
5. Committed a new markdown file.
6. I have pushed the new branch.

I want to know more about 
1. the difference between Tortoise SVN and git.

Thank you.
